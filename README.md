# Approach to User Stories:
## User Story 1

> As a customer
> So that I can check if I want to order something
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

The customer is requesting a menu - my approach here was to create a menu class that holds the prices / list of items on sale.

I added a basic interaction front to this.
